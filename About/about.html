          Gelato and World was born out of my passion for traveling with the aim 
          of inspiring other people to see the world and do everything they love.
          After traveling through 21 countries, while studying and working full time, my aim
          is to show others that traveling is not just a distant dream.

          On this site, you will find tips, city guides, travel inspiration and 
           stories of my adventures around the world. Furthermore, you’ll discover

      <div class="div-one">
      <div>
        As a child I traveled a lot by car with my parents. We simply thought like suitcases in the car and went into discovery. There was nothing
programmed, we didn’t have GPS, Internet on the cell phone and almost always what guided us was the map.
      </div>
      <div>
        These childhood memories were joined by the opportunity to exchange between schools and when I lived for a week in Italy with a wonderful
family, the desire to discover new places and cultures.
      </div>
      <div>
        Later, in 2014, I took an Interrail through Europe with my sister. It was amazing! One of the biggest adventures of my life. As we weren’t able to
visit every country, we decided to do a second Interrail two years later. That same year, I started sharing on my Instagram account all the
discoveries of new places I was making.
      </div>

      <div class="div-two">
      <div>
        In 2018, I decided to travel alone to 6 countries in 22 days. Along the way, I lost access to my Instagram account, however I wanted to continue
sharing my travel experiences with others. That’s how, on one of the best trips of my life, my new Instagram “Gelato and World” was born.
      </div>
      <div>
        After creating Instagram “Gelato and World” I continued to travel and show everyone who follows me that traveling is not a distant dream and
that at least one new place is known every year.
      </div>
      <div>
        Since 2014 until today I’ve been to 21 countries and many of them I’ve been to more than once. Right now, I’m a content creator for Instagram
        “Gelato and World” and I continue to travel the world whenever possible.

              Funny stories from my travels: I slept with beggars in Venice because I couldn't afford accommodation. In Pisa, I was bitten by bed bugs when I
              slept in a hostel. I slept on the beach in Monterosso. In Belgium, I almost went to the police station.

              Fun Facts: I sleep with my eyes open a little. I don't like to sleep with the closet doors open. I've already missed an exam at the university
              because I didn't know where the room was.
